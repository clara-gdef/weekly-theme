# Weekly Themes

Welcome to this simple package that will draw a random theme for your upcoming week.
This theme is meant to be a source of inspiration for your week, and can be used in any way you see fit.
I personally use it to drive my outfits, makeup, and even as an extra nudge when I need to make decisions and I feel a bit lost.

I hope you like it!
